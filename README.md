🔐 Ashley Madison Data Breach – Application Security Research Project
Course: Application Security (Spring 2024)
Created by: Kayla Rada

✨ Overview
This project was a deep dive into one of the most notorious data breaches in recent history. The 2015 Ashley Madison hack. As part of my Application Security course, I researched the full scope of the incident, from how the breach occurred to the lasting ethical and technical implications. I compiled my findings into a detailed written report and a PowerPoint presentation. This project sharpened my understanding of real-world cybersecurity failures and taught me what can go wrong when trust, transparency, and security aren’t prioritized.

🚨 CCARR Breakdown (Challenge, Context, Action, Result, Reflection)
🔹 Challenge / Context
The assignment was to investigate a major cybersecurity breach, identify how it happened, and analyze both the technical and human vulnerabilities involved. I chose the Ashley Madison breach because of its unique mix of social, ethical, and technical failures—and its wide-reaching impact on real people.

🔧 Action
I conducted extensive research on the timeline of the breach, the actors involved (like Impact Team), and the underlying vulnerabilities—like weak password storage, poor encryption, and lack of internal security segmentation. I created a professional-style report detailing the root causes and failures in both policy and infrastructure. Alongside the report, I built a presentation to walk through the technical breakdown and offer practical takeaways for improving application security.

✅ Result
My final deliverables included:

A written report documenting the breach, the technical failures, and ethical dilemmas

A presentation summarizing the event and recommending preventive security practices

A well-rounded understanding of application security concepts, including encryption, segmentation, ethical hacking, and user trust

💭 Reflection
This project gave me real insight into how even companies with millions of users can fail at the fundamentals of cybersecurity. From poor password practices to ethical missteps (like charging users for “full deletes” that didn’t fully erase data), Ashley Madison’s downfall became a case study in what not to do. It emphasized the importance of strong encryption, monitoring, transparency, and ethical responsibility in building secure systems. I left this project more aware of the stakes involved in application security—and more motivated to design safer, more responsible systems in the future.
