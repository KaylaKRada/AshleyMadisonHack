# 🔓 Ashley Madison Data Breach Report – Application Security  
**Course:** Application Security  
**Created by:** Kayla Rada  

---

## 🕵️‍♀️ Overview  
This research project dives deep into one of the most infamous cybersecurity breaches of the last decade: the 2015 Ashley Madison hack. The assignment asked us to explore a real-world security incident, analyze how it happened, and reflect on what we could learn to prevent similar attacks in the future.

I wrote a full investigative-style report and designed a PowerPoint presentation to communicate the events, technical failures, and ethical dilemmas that made the breach so catastrophic. This case stood out not only for the data exposure, but for the devastating human impact it caused—and how much of it could have been prevented.

## 🧩 CCARR Breakdown (Challenge, Context, Action, Result, Reflection)

### 🔹 **Challenge / Context**  
For my Application Security class, I needed to research and present a real-world data breach. I wanted to choose a case that had both technical depth and social impact, and the Ashley Madison breach checked both boxes. It wasn’t just about weak passwords or lazy security—it exposed a flawed system built on promises of secrecy, trust, and discretion.

### 🔧 **Action**  
I researched the breach from both technical and ethical angles. I examined how the Impact Team exploited Ashley Madison's lack of segmentation, poor password encryption, and failure to secure user data. I compiled my findings into a well-organized written report and built a presentation to walk through the timeline, root causes, and lessons learned. I also analyzed the fallout, including the legal, financial, and personal consequences.

### ✅ **Result**  
The final result was a comprehensive report and presentation that covered:
- The site's origins and growth  
- How the attack occurred  
- A breakdown of the vulnerabilities exploited  
- The aftermath and public response  
- Security best practices and takeaways  

I received strong feedback on how clearly I communicated both the technical failures and ethical consequences. It helped sharpen my analytical thinking and gave me practice presenting complex topics in an understandable way.

### 💭 **Reflection**  
This project showed me how security is about much more than code—it’s about trust. Ashley Madison failed not just as a platform, but as a promise to its users. It reminded me that security needs to be baked into every layer of design, especially when handling sensitive data. It also reinforced my interest in ethical tech development and responsible system design.
